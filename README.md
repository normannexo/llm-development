# LLM Development Learning Repository

A personal collection of experiments, scripts, and applications exploring various aspects of Large Language Model (LLM) development. This repository serves as a companion on my learning journey.

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This repository is actively evolving as I learn and experiment with different LLM technologies. Code quality, documentation, and structure may vary across projects.

## 📚 Repository Structure

- **1 BASICS** - Fundamental concepts and starter examples
- **2 RAG** - Retrieval Augmented Generation implementations
- **3 AGENTS** - LLM agent experiments using frameworks like SmolAgents and Langgraph
- **4 TEXT TO SQL** - Natural language to SQL conversion using LangChain and LlamaIndex
- **GRADIO** - UI implementations using Gradio
- **DATA** - Sample datasets for testing and development

## 🛠️ Technologies

- LangChain
- LlamaIndex
- SmolAgents
- Langgraph
- Gradio
- Anthropic Claude
- Mistral AI
- HuggingFace

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv .venv`
3. Activate the environment:
   - Windows: `.venv\Scripts\activate`
   - Linux/Mac: `source .venv/bin/activate`
4. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Create a `.env` file with your API keys (see `.env.example`)

## 📝 Notes

- Each subdirectory contains its own README with specific information
- Scripts are organized by technology and use case
- This is a personal learning project, not production-ready code

## 📄 License

This project is for personal educational purposes. Feel free to explore and learn from it, but please use your own API keys for any services.
